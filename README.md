# Sumit Kumar
I graduated in Chemical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IITK) with outstanding academic performance and a published Research Paper. I am an enthusiastic and passionate Process &amp; Technology Engineer with nearly 4 years of experience spanning the Petrochemical and Pharma Industries.

Possessing strong technical knowledge and expertise in process & technology design, CFD modeling, and scale-up engineering, I am proficient in tools such as ANSYS Workbench, Aspen Plus, Aspen HYSYS, Power BI, and Microsoft Office. I am eager to leverage these skills to drive technological advancements and innovation within the Petrochemical Industry.

My professional journey began at Dr. Reddy's Laboratories as a Technical Trainee under the Young Leadership Program (YLP) in the Pharma Industry. There, I gained extensive experience in process scale-up engineering, modeling & simulation, design, and technology transfer within the Injectables department as a Process Engineering Specialist. Transitioning to the Petrochemical Industry, I joined Polycycl as a Senior Technology and Process Engineer, where I oversee engineering design, project implementation, and technology transfer initiatives.

Additionally, I gained valuable internship experience with Reliance Industries Ltd at the world's largest Manufacturing Complex, the Jamnagar manufacturing division, in the Oil & Gas Industry.

During my academic tenure at IITK, I conducted research on the time-dependent rheology of granular materials, resulting in the publication of the research paper "Unsteady granular chute flow at high inertial numbers" in Physical Review Fluids by the American Physical Society.
